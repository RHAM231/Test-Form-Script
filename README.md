# Test-Form-Script
Repository for my web form test script using Selenium


Let's create an automated form submission script that can be activated with a button click to make testing our contact forms easier.

We'll use code from https://towardsdatascience.com/automating-submission-forms-with-python-94459353b03e
as a starting point.

# Build Status
Script works for testing portfolio site contact form. Debugging an error with testing the Hope Medical contact form. Expanding to include tests for the Hope Medical registration form and Issue Tracker's forms.
